    }
    For "subject", "action", "object", be as generic and short as possible.
    Do not use different words for the same object, e.g. "convertible car" and "convertible".
    When the belief does not have an action, but instead use a verb such as 'to be' for instance, then put the verb in the <action anyway>, 
    and use the field 'object' to describe what the object or person is or is made of or anything else that the verb describes.

    Use infinitive verbs, without the 'to', ie 'be' instead of 'is'.
