    High-level function adding a User node into a graph

    Constraints on labels and properties can be set to prevent duplicates
    E.g.
    createNode(g, ('User', 'SessionId'),
                user_id = 'JP007',  # **{'userid':'JP007'} if one prefers dictionaries
                properties_constraints=('user_id,),

        in which case, if DEBUG is True, it will return None and display a msg
        such as "Node ('User', SessionID') already exists with ID = 309"

    WARNING: with no constraints, the code will use ALL the labels and
        properties to test for unicity.  This may be a problem with some
        properties such as 'transcript' holding all the conversations
        because, for sure, any node with everything else identical (user id ...)
        will still differ if the transcripts is taken into account, and
        a new node will be created.

        It is possible to avoid using constraints by creating a node first
        with the labels and properties that must be unique, and then
        update / add properties.

        See https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/constraints/ to understand
        how constraints work.  Only the business edition has property existence
        constraints.
